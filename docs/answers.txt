d)	Branches are used to help manage workflow. It allows you to make changes
	and experiment in a safe way.

e)	Git Log shows commits with their respective titles and notes whereas
	git status shows files that have been modified since the previous commit.

h)	i.   Inheritance is when an object/class acquires attributes from another class.
	ii.  Polymorphism is when there are multiple functions of the same name, but 
	     with different parameters. 
	iii. Encapsulation is putting information, data, and functions into a class.

i)	Centralized workflow allows for anyone to push their version to the
	repository. Others would have to update their version before they're able
	push again. In Dictator and Lieutenants, someone would have to submit
	their code to someone above them in the hierarchy.
	
j)	A team of 100 developers would benefit more by following the "Dictator
	and Lieutenants" workflow instead of "Centralized" because of the large
	amount of people. Conflicts would arise if it were Centralized workflow
	and it would be difficult to fix all of the errors that could result from
	the indepenedent work of multiple people.
